    "There are several ways to implement this. The most naive way to think of this problem is to sort the array over and over again when `addNum` is called. However, there is better data structure called heap which we can use to maintain the maximum number on the left half of the array (using max heap) and the minimum number on the right half of the array (using min heap). Inserting elements to a heap can be done in logarithmic time.\n",

    "When `findMedian` is called, we just need to check whether the heaps are of same size (which means the original data array has even number of elements; return the average of two middle elements) or of different size (which means the original data array has odd number of elements; return the middle element).\n",
    "\n",
