    "A transformation sequence from word `beginWord` to word `endWord` using a dictionary `wordList` is a sequence of words `beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk` such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.\n",
    "    Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.\n",
    "    sk == endWord\n",

    "Given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`, or 0 if no such sequence exists.\n",

    "First, create an adjacency mapping for each word in the `wordList`. What that means is, for each word, what are other words in the wordList that it can go with one character swapping. If the word is \"dog\", \n",
    "There are three places where characters can be swapped\n",
    "\n",
    "1) First character -> (*)og\n",
    "2) Second character -> d(*)g\n",
    "3) Third character -> do(*)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our adjacency mapping maps these patterns to words in the `wordList`\n",
    "\n",
    "For exapmle, if we have, `beginWord` dig, `endWord` doc and `wordList` [dog, cat, dig, cot, hog, dot, doc, rat, bat, cap, car], the adjacency mapping will be:\n",
    "       \n",
    "       {\"*og\": ['dog', 'hog'],\n",
    "         \"d*g\": ['dog', 'dig'],\n",

    "Having this mapping, we just need to check whether a character for the current word can be swapped to get to `endWord`. So, we try to swap every possible character position in the current word and look up the value in our adjacency mapping. We do that for each word in the adjacency mapping until we find the `endWord`. If we encounter `endWord` while checking for words in adjacency mapping, we can return the 1+level at which we are in. If we have exhausted everything, it is sure that we have not found the word and we can return 0.\n",
