    "Given an `MxN` grid with road blocks (cells marked by 1), get the number of possible paths that a robot can take to get to the bottom-right cell of the grid (goal) from top-left cell (starting point). The robot can only move down or right.\n",

    "Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "[[0, 0, 0],\n",
    " [0, 0, 0],\n",

    "\n",
    "The approach presented here is a dynamic programming approach rather than using BFS or DFS. The idea is so ask: If I want to know the number of paths that I can take to get to a particular cell at i-th row and j-th column, how many paths can I take to get to top cell and to left cell. All you need to do is to add them up."
